# Train-Schedule

This Repo contains a database for train schedules using Firebase. This is a project for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Overview

This assignment uses jQuery and a database called Firebase to dynamically update the webpage with train schedule information. The data is stored within Firebase and will remain there unless deleted by the server. In addition, becuase javascript does not handle the concept of time, Moment.js is used. This allows the application to handle time accordingly. The user can view train schedules, as well as add a new train to the database via the form at the bottom. There is a world clock at the top for an improved UI. 


### Installing

No need to install anything.

## Tech Used

* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript 
* JQuery
* Moment.js 

## Problem Solving:

This was one of the more enjoyable assignments I've had during the bootcamp. Using moment.js was one of the more tricky tasks I had in this project. By using moment.js, I was able to make the scheduler update with current times. I would later use this technology in Project 1 to make more dynamic API calls.
