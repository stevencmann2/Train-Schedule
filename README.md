Problem Solving:

This was one of the more enjoyable assignments I've had during the bootcamp. Using moment.js was one of the more tricky tasks I had in this project. By using moment.js, I was able to make the scheduler update with current times. I would later use this technology in Project 1 to make more dynamic API calls. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Moment.js
